# C++ Fluid Simulation
This is a C++ project built with SFML visualization library based on Jos Stam's paper [Real Time Fluid Simulations for Games](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf). This simulation is based on solving the Navier-Stokes Equations. 

## Running this Simulation
Use `make run` to compile and run the simulation.
Make sure you have g++, Make, and SFML installed.

## Future Progress
Use OpenGL shaders for better simulation performance.
Add obstacles for fluid flow. 
Add color mixing.
